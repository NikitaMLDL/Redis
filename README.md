backend.py
This file implements a simple FastAPI application that interacts with a Redis database.

Initialization: It initializes a FastAPI app.
User Check Endpoint: The /check_user/{user_id} endpoint takes a user ID as input and checks if it exists in the Redis database. It connects to Redis with SSL, retrieves the user data using a pipeline for efficiency, and returns the count of the user (or 0 if the user doesn't exist).
Server Setup: If the script is run directly, it starts a local server on 127.0.0.1:8080 using Uvicorn.
main.py
This file uses Flask and Flask-Restful to create a RESTful API to manage user profiles.

Initialization: It initializes a Flask app and establishes a connection to Redis.
UserProfile Resource: This resource allows:
POST: Create a new user profile if it doesn't exist.
PUT: Update an existing user profile.
DELETE: Remove a user profile if it exists.
AdminActions Resource: Provides endpoints for:
GET: Retrieve all user profiles.
DELETE: Clear the database of all user profiles.
Endpoint Registration: The resources are added to the API with specific routes.
main_redis.py
This file creates a Telegram bot that interacts with users and manages their profiles stored in Redis.

Bot Initialization: A Telegram bot is set up using a token (which is expected to be provided).
User Profile Management:
/start: Welcomes the user and prompts for creating a profile.
/create: Prompts the user to enter their name and age to create a profile.
/update: Allows users to update their profile with a new name and age.
/delete: Deletes the user's profile if it exists.
Admin Commands: Provides admin functionalities to view all user profiles or delete them with ease.
Error Handling: Catches Redis connection errors and prints appropriate messages if an exception occurs.
Overall, this project demonstrates how to create a user management system using a combination of FastAPI, Flask, Redis, and a Telegram bot. It supports CRUD operations for user profiles while also providing admin functionalities for managing the information stored in Redis. ðŸš€âœ¨
